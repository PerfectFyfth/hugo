## faq

**can I use your songs in my own work?**\
yes, you can use my music non-commercially as long as you give credit when needed.

**why isn't your music on / can you put your music on streaming services (e.g. Spotify, Apple Music, etc)**\
no. i don't want to bother with distributing my music, as that seems like it would be a pain
