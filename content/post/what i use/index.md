#### most of the stuff i use is free, unless stated otherwise.

## GRAPHICS

- [GNU IMAGE MANIPULATION PROGRAM (GIMP)](https://www.gimp.org/) - basically the free and open source alternative for Photoshop. the ui / ux is divisive, to say the least, but i've been using it almost exclusively for almost all of my graphics, and it definitely can do the job.
- [ASEPRITE](https://www.aseprite.org/) - art program designed with pixel art in mind. has a great, intuitive interface.

- [BLENDER](https://www.blender.org/) - THE program for anything 3D. i'm not sure what else to say about it. most of art / visuals done in blender.
- [TOUCHDESIGNER](https://derivative.ca/) - a really powerful visual programming language. it can do a ton of things, and i recommend looking into it, but i mainly use it for live, audio-reactive visuals.

## MUSIC/AUDIO

### DAW / STANDALONE PROGRAMS

- [REAPER](https://reaper.fm) - my main DAW since 2019, a bit of a learning curve for some, but lightweight, really flexible and customizable. us$60 for a personal license, but the free trial version lasts forever without any limitation.
- [bespoke synth](https://www.bespokesynth.com/) - a really neat, completely free modular synth / DAW environment, really neat for sound design, and working with live.

- [SONOBUS](https://www.sonobus.net/) - audio plugin or standalone program for sharing audio, great for collaboration.

### VST PLUGINS

#### Instruments

- [VITAL](https://vital.audio) - you probably know about vital already, hands down the best free (and arguably non-free as well) software synthesizer. it does just about everything.
- [HELM](https://tytel.org/helm) - earlier synth from the same creator as vital, not nearly as powerful, but simple, and has an interesting sound, especially with the modulation, feedback, and distortion.
- [SPITFIRE AUDIO LABS](https://labs.spitfireaudio.com/) - spitfire offers a lot of great free instrument sample libraries, i like a lot of their atmospheric sounds.
- [MT - POWERDRUMKIT](https://www.powerdrumkit.com/) - a decent free drum kit.
- [T-FORCE ALPHA PLUS](https://mastrcode-music.de/en/vst-plugins/t-force-alpha-plus/) - a little unstable from my testing, but a great synth for trance and anything that needs large supersaws and whatnot
- [KEYZONE CLASSIC](https://plugins4free.com/plugin/2848/) - just a basic piano plugin, i'm not sure what to say about this one.

#### Effects

- [AIRWINDOWS](https://www.airwindows.com/) - a TON of small, lightweight, cpu efficient audio effects. they usually do one thing, but do it very well.
- [TAL FREE PLUGINS](https://tal-software.com/products) - tal offers a really full, free reverb. i haven't used many of their other plugins but they are pretty solid as well.
- [KJAERHUS AUDIO CLASSIC PLUGINS](https://archive.org/details/classic-auto-filter) - although they are old plugins from a long-defunct company, they are still really solid effects plugins, and especially their auto-filter.
- [OTT](https://xferrecords.com/freeware) - this thing is a meme at this point. an over-the-top multiband compression plugin, that that can crush any sound, that works for a lot of things, for better or for worse.
- [ALLPASSPHASE](https://github.com/enummusic/allpassphase) - free and open source clone of the popular plugin from kilohearts, disperser. it has a really unique, immediately recognizable, bubbly, weird sound. this is achieved by abusing multiband artifacts, which i won't get into detail now, but [Inverted Silence has a great video on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHi__JOLs54)
- [TRANSPIRE](https://plugins4free.com/plugin/2777/) - a solid free transient shaper plugin. not sure what to say about this one either.

#### resources for REAPER

- [REAPACK](https://reapack.com/) - package manager for REAPER. makes managing REAPER plugins and extensions much easier.

themes

- [HYDRA theme](https://stash.reaper.fm/theme/2085/HYDRA.ReaperThemeZip) - a good minimal REAPER theme.
- [Default Commala 5](https://stash.reaper.fm/theme/1702/Default_Commala_5.ReaperThemeZip) - the theme i use.

extensions

- [GLOBAL SAMPLER](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=2506514) a powerful tool for sound design, lets you record everything happening in your DAW.

JS plugins

- [SAIKE TOOLS](https://github.com/JoepVanlier/JSFX) - a lot of good free JS plugins.
- [GERAINT LUFF](https://geraintluff.github.io/jsfx/) - same as above, but with somewhat more experimental plugins.

#### to use JS plugins outsude of REAPER, you can use a VST wrapper called [YSFX](https://github.com/jpcima/ysfx)

### MISC

- [YABRIDGE](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge) - Wine VST bridge, allows you to run Windows VST plugins on Linux.
