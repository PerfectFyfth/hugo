this track was made for Chips Compo's Audio Secret Santa 2021\
if you're not familiar, the premise is that you request a song for someone to make, then you are given a prompt to make for someone else.\
my request, form cashwarrior, was "Love me some beautifully written 6/8 music. Thinking of something slower, a little waltz-like, but a major emphasis on melody."
