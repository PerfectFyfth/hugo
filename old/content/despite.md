i was originally planning to do some kind of collab with [clwdy](https://clwdytunes.carrd.co/) for for [Form](https://artbyform.com/) All Nighter Vol. 7, but after trying to come up with a thing for hours, we realised we couldn't really come up with much of anything, so we split off and did our own things.\
i spent hours after that attempting to come up with something to no avail, and with approximately 8 hours before the deadline, i was on the verge of completely giving up. but in the last four hours, i was set. i wasn't giving up. i was going to do something. so in about 3 hours, i threw this together. despite everything, i still managed to make something.\
despite all odds is that track, it didn't make it onto the compilation, so i self-released it.
### you can listen to it here on [bandcamp](https://perfectfyfth.bandcamp.com/track/despite-all-odds), [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/perfectfyfth/despite-all-odds), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZWg60KG_Kg), and [newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/1150538)

random note: i really like how the visuals turned out on the video, even if it's just a short looping animation
